# ⌈ <font color="#9945FF">CLAIM LOGIC & VERIFICATION</font> ⌋

To maintain the scarcity of the **Physical Solana Series**, we employ a manual verification process backed by on-chain data.

---

### 1. THE TRANSACTION
Users must transfer the required **$SATORI** amount to the designated vault. 
* **Network:** Solana Mainnet
* **Token Mint:** `YOUR_PUMPFUN_MINT_ADDRESS`
* **Vault:** `YOUR_SOL_VAULT_ADDRESS`

### 2. VERIFICATION PARAMETERS
Our team manually audits the **Transaction Signature (TxID)**. We check for:
* **Correct Amount:** Exactly the required $SATORI amount.
* **Timestamp:** Must occur before the "Sold Out" status is reached.
* **Wallet Consistency:** The wallet used for the transfer must match the one provided in the claim form.

### 3. THE REDEMPTION WORKFLOW

1. **Initiate:** Send $SATORI tokens.
2. **Document:** Save your Solana Explorer link.
3. **Submit:** Open a [Physical Redemption Issue](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/issues/new?template=redemption.yml).
4. **Encrypt:** Provide shipping details via **PGP Encryption** or a secure one-time link (e.g., Privnote) within the issue.
5. **Fulfill:** Once the TxID is confirmed, the coin is struck and shipped.

### ⌈ <font color="#14F195">SECURITY PROTOCOL</font> ⌋
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Satori Mint staff will **NEVER** ask for your seed phrase. We only require a public TxID and a shipping destination. For maximum privacy, we recommend using a PO Box.
